# Linear Search
(1/3)

Linear search is used on a collections of items. It relies on the technique of **traversing** a list from start to end by exploring properties of all the elements that are found on the way.

For example, consider an array of intefers of size *N*. You should find and print the position of all the elements with value *x*.
Here, the linear search is based on the idea of matching each element from the beginning of the list to the end of the list with the integer *x*, and then printing the position of the element if the condition is `True`.

## Implementation

The pseudo code for this example is as follows:

```
for (stat to end of array)
{
    if (current_element equals to 5)
    {
        print (current_index);
    }
}
```
